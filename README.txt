Our TicTacToe game implementation works in command line and offers nxn game field with size limited by 10x10(to prevent
the use of too much memory or the slow work of the AI algorithm).
User can play with his friend on one computer or with one of two types of AI implemented:
First type is random AI: It just puts his sign in random place.
The second type is tree-based AI: It puts his sign in place, that will lead to the smallest available amount of  steps,
that will lead  to his victory.
